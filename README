"smart_irrigation" is a project aimed at creating a smart irrigation timer.
The timer will be programmable through a web interface and will be able to
query a weather API in order to adjust its watering schedule. The project
comprises two parts called timer_control and valve_control.

########## timer_control ##########

"timer_control" contains modules/software that run on the raspberry pi. 
Additionally, it contains yocto configuration files and a layer used to 
build the linux system for the raspberry pi.

	bcm2835_spi - user-mode spi library (no longer used)
	spi_dev - spi kernel module for communication with the microcontroller
	yocto - linux build configuration and layer files

########## valve_control ##########

"valve_control" contains the firmware for the stm32f051 microcontroller. It
handles communication with the raspberry pi and controls the valves.

########## yocto ##########

Contains the Yocto Project layer and configuration files.

########## vc-driver ##########

Contains the driver for the microcontroller.
